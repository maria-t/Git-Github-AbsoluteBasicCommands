# Working with Git and Github - Absolute Basics 

- to initialize a project repository, in your project repository run the command
`git init .`

- to clone a repository 
*This command will pull in a complete copy of a remote repository to your local system*
`git clone <repository URL>`

- to see the current status of your working repository (untracked files, changes to be committed, etc)
`git status`

- to stage a file, i.e., to prepare it for a final commit
`git add <filename>`

- to configure the editor, which Git is using when you write commit messages
`git config --global core.editor <your editor's name>`

- to record changes to your local repository
`git commit`

- to view a list of changes of your project repository in reverse chronological order
`git log`

### Adding my project to github
1. Create a new repository in github.
2. Copy the first line under `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` and paste it in the terminal.
3. Copy the second line and paste it in the terminal. This will push our changes to Github.
